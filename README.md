Project Title: Credit Card Fraud Detection using Random Forest

Project Description:

Objective:
The main objective of this project is to develop a robust credit card fraud detection system using the Random Forest algorithm. Credit card fraud is a significant concern for both financial institutions and consumers. Detecting fraudulent transactions in real-time is crucial to prevent financial losses and protect customers. Random Forest, being an ensemble learning algorithm, is well-suited for this task due to its ability to handle complex patterns and provide reliable predictions.
